Let's find out what the browser does and get excited !
Well, in this article, we will learn how the browser works behind the scenes.
As a front-end developer, I always wanted to talk about this topic, which is covered in this article üåç

The browser does five things to render the page (Rendering Pipeline):

1. JavaScript
2. Style
3. Layout
4. Paint
5. Composite

Before the browser starts the rendering operation, it needs a HTML file
This is how the user opens the browser and enters the address of a site in the address bar and searches.

### DOM:

The browser requests and receives HTML from that server, and now the browser has HTML and can run the rendering pipeline.
The HTML received from the server is parsed, resulting in a Document Object Model (DOM) tree.
The browser must convert this string with parsing operation and the result of parsing is DOM (Document Object Model).
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
Next, the browser calculates the styles to be applied to the DOM elements.

### Style:

In fact, this is the same CSS that we have written and it should be applied to the DOM elements
Now, how does the browser do this?
It downloads CSS, parses them and creates a tree called CSSOM (CSS Object Model)
And in the next step will be browser merge DOM and CSSOM and create Render Tree .
Note: When the browser tries to make a Tree rendering, it removes the elements that are not on the DOM.

### Layout:

For a browser to understand where each element is placed on the DOM, it is called Layout
And it is one of the most expensive things that the browser does
Note: read more about [layout shift](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/LayoutShift).

### Paint:

In the paint operation, the browser must tell which element is placed on which element (like: position, z-index, etc, ...)
An example for the above is Modal
Paint operation is the most expensive and complicated operation for the browser, so we should optimize this step as much as possible.
Note: read more about [optimize painting](https://css-tricks.com/browser-painting-and-considerations-for-web-performance/?__im-takUyAlO=7950810043045485814).

### Composite:

The composite step is where the browser combines all the visual elements created during rendering into a single cohesive layer, ensuring smooth and efficient display on the screen. This process involves arranging elements according to their stacking order, applying transformations, blending layers, and optimizing rendering performance.
One effective technique for optimizing rendering performance, especially for animations, is to utilize CSS transforms. Transformations applied using CSS, such as translate, rotate, scale, and skew, are hardware-accelerated and can significantly improve animation performance by leveraging the browser's composite capabilities.
Note: Leveraging composite operations through CSS transforms can lead to smoother animations and better overall performance, especially on devices with limited resources. üòâ

### JavaScript:

After all of this JavaScript is executed
Note: Before JavaScript is executed, it must be downloaded and then it must be parsed and converted to byte code.

![js](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGDrTlnRRTLfA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1710095476885?e=1730332800&v=beta&t=zVkr_hzbCxIyvH1oLmO6hokOiAUNEgpkMuSY9TI4tX0)

At the end Rendering steps include style, layout, paint, and in some cases compositing. The CSSOM and DOM trees created in the parsing step are combined into a render tree which is then used to compute the layout of every visible element, which is then painted to the screen.
